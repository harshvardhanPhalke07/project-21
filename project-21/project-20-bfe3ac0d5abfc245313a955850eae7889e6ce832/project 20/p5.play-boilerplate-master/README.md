# p5.play-boilerplate
Boiler plate for p5.play
so, seeing the effectiveness of my previous car crash simulator,
/*the company has funded me to create this simulator*/
so, this one simulates bullets hitting a wall.
each wall has different materials to be tested by hitting those bullets to /*each wall*/
if a material recieves damage **more then 10**, it will be rejected.
But if a material recieves damage **less than 10** it will be accepted and used in making the wall
